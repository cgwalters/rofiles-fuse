=========

Create a mountpoint that represents an underlying directory hierarchy,
but where non-directory inodes cannot have content or xattrs changed.
Files can still be unlinked, and new ones created.

This filesystem is designed for OSTree - it's useful for computing
overlay filesystems based on underlying hardlinked trees.
